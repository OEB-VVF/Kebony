> Module: All | Updated: 2026-04-27
>
> **Changes since v2.0**: explicit `kebony_parent_id` dual-semantics callout (§5.6), `x_studio_master_item_code_1` (M2O) distinguished from `_master_item_code` (Char), AX decimeter encoding documented (§15.3), Imperial→Metric twin proposal rule (§3.6), yield-trim rule (§5.6), forward-looking architecture for the master-centric screen, description propagation model, and deferred country/language localization (§17).

## 1. Executive Summary

The Product Master is the **single most critical data entity** in Kebony's Odoo 19 platform. Every business process — from sales quotation to manufacturing execution, from margin analysis to customs declaration — is anchored to the product record. A single field error on a product propagates across inventory valuation, costing, invoicing, logistics, and compliance.

This document is the **definitive reference** for:

- **What** a Kebony product is (identity, dimensions, classification)
- **What it drives** (the downstream impact on every functional domain)
- **How it is structured** in Odoo 19 (technical field names, types, values)
- **Who owns it** (governance, RACI, change control)

**Design principle**: Product Master Data is infrastructure. It must be treated with the same rigour as financial chart of accounts or manufacturing Bill of Materials. No field should be added, renamed, or repurposed without formal validation.

---

## 2. Why Product Matters — Downstream Impact Map

Every product record in Kebony's system feeds — directly or indirectly — into **13 functional domains**. A change to a single product attribute can cascade through all of them.

| # | Domain | What Product Drives |
|---|--------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Sales** | Quotation, pricing, packaging UoM |
| 2 | **Pricing** | Pricelist rules, price per lm / m² / m³ |
| 3 | **Inventory** | FIFO valuation, lot tracking, quant metrics |
| 4 | **Manufacturing** | BoM generation, dryer load planning, chemical mix |
| 5 | **Capacity Planning** | Dryer / autoclave scheduling, bottleneck analysis |
| 6 | **Costing & Margin** | Standard cost, COGS split, margin per m³ |
| 7 | **Accounting** | GL routing, analytic distribution, accruals |
| 8 | **Logistics** | Weight, pallet dims, transport planning |
| 9 | **Packaging** | Pack / Board UoMs, picking, shipping labels |
| 10 | **Compliance** | HS codes, intrastat, customs declarations |
| 11 | **Website** | Catalogue, filtering, search, display |
| 12 | **Purchasing** | Vendor bills, consignment, raw material linkage |
| 13 | **Samples** | Sample workflows, services available |

**The implication is clear**: a product record is not just a "catalogue entry" — it is a **load-bearing data structure** that underpins the financial, operational, and regulatory integrity of the entire platform.

---

## 3. Architecture Principle

### 3.1 No Dimensional Variants

Odoo 19 merged packaging and UoM into a single concept. A product sold as "Pack of 162 × 3.2 lm" and "Board of 3.2 lm" requires packaging-level UoMs that depend on the product's length. This makes dimensional variants structurally impossible.

**Rule**: Each dimensional product = its own `product.template`. No variant axes for length, width, or thickness.

### 3.2 Metric / Imperial Structural Separation

Metric and imperial products are **separate templates** linked by a shared Master Item Code and a Metric-Imperial Master Code. The metric product is the engineering source of truth; imperial equivalents derive from it.

| Concept | Metric Example | Imperial Equivalent |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Name | `1127-M-3.2` | `1127-I-10.5` |
| Master Item Code | `1127` | `1127` |
| Master Variant Code | `1127-3.2` | `1127-2.74` |
| Metric-Imperial Master | `1127-M` | `1127-I` |
| UoM | m (meter) | LF (linear foot) |
| Company | Kebony Holding (BE) | Kebony Holding (BE) |

**Relational link (added 2026-04)**: imperial SKUs are also linked to their metric twin via `kebony_parent_id` (Many2one → product.template). See §5.6 for the full specification. This enables the **imperial↔metric flow**: a US purchase order in imperial can be translated to a metric SO at the BE factory, produced in metric, delivered in metric, and converted back to imperial at US receipt — all driven by the parent link.

### 3.3 Treatment ≠ Variant

Treatment (fire retardant, colour finish, brushing) is applied post-production and tracked at **lot level only**. Product identity remains purely dimensional. This prevents combinatorial SKU explosion: each cross-section exists in ~20 length variants across metric and imperial, and each could carry up to 4 treatments — meaning ~70 cross-sections × ~20 lengths × 4 treatments × 2 measurement systems = **~11,200 potential SKUs** reduced to the current ~490 by keeping treatment at lot level and length as a structural product axis rather than a variant.

### 3.4 Three-Level Hierarchy

```
Master Item (e.g. 1127)
  └── Master Variant (e.g. 1127-3.2)
        ├── Metric Product (1127-M-3.2)  ← sellable, stockable
        └── Imperial Product (1127-I-10.5) ← sellable, stockable
```

- **Master Item** (`x_studio_is_master_item = True`): non-sellable, non-purchasable grouping record representing the cross-section (e.g., "Kebony Character Decking 28×120")
- **Master Variant** (`x_studio_is_master_variant = True`): non-sellable grouping by dimension (e.g., "1127-3.2" = 28×120 at 3.2m length)
- **Metric-Imperial Master** (`x_studio_product_family_1 = True`): links metric and imperial twins under one code (e.g., `1127-M`)
- **Sellable Product**: the actual stockable, sellable `product.template` (e.g., `1127-M-3.2`)

### 3.5 Imperial → Metric Twin Proposal Rule

Imperial SKUs are commercially sold in **standard foot lengths** (8, 10, 12, 14, 16 ft). For each Imperial SKU, the system proposes the **nearest Metric length** as its physical twin (the `kebony_parent_id` target):

| Imperial | Equivalent in metres | Proposed Metric twin |
|---|---|---|
| `1127-I-8` | 2.438 m | `1127-M-2.4` or `1127-M-2.5` |
| `1127-I-10` | 3.048 m | `1127-M-3.0` or `1127-M-3.2` |
| `1127-I-12` | 3.658 m | `1127-M-3.6` or `1127-M-3.7` |
| `1127-I-14` | 4.267 m | `1127-M-4.2` or `1127-M-4.3` |
| `1127-I-16` | 4.877 m | `1127-M-4.8` or `1127-M-4.9` |

The proposal is **flagged for business validation** (red/white inverted cell in the Phase A review Excel). Never auto-confirm — the choice between two adjacent metric lengths depends on customer expectations, packaging conventions, and stock availability.

**Future master-form button**: "Generate Imperial twin lengths" — on a metric Master, generates the standard 8/10/12/14/16 ft Imperial children with the proposed twin pre-filled.

### 3.6 Product Population

| Segment | Metric | Imperial | Total |
|---------|--------|----------|-------|
| Character (Scots Pine) | 30 | ~30 | ~60 |
| Clear (Radiata) | 117 | 117 | ~234 |
| Master Items | ~70 | — | ~70 |
| Master Variants | ~80 | — | ~80 |
| Accessories | — | — | ~27 |
| Services / Other | — | — | ~20 |
| **Estimated Total** | | | **~490** |

## 4. Measurement Doctrine

### 4.1 Three Dimensions of Quantity

| Dimension | Unit | Display | Role |
|-----------|------|---------|------|
| **Linear** | meters (m) | m, lm, LF | Operational — normalised to meters |
| **Board count** | integer | boards | Informational — ROUND_UP at 0.95 |
| **Volume** | m³ | m³, ft³ | **Economic truth** — all KPIs in m³ |

### 4.2 Two Volume Fields — Critical Distinction

| Field | Technical Name | Unit | Usage |
|-------|---------------|------|-------|
| Normalised | `x_studio_volume_m3` | Always m³/lm | **Canonical.** All economic calcs. |
| Localised | `volume` (Odoo) | m³/lm or ft³/lf | Transport docs only. **Never for metrics.** |

**Formula**: `Total volume = linear_meters × x_studio_volume_m3`

### 4.3 Conversion Constants

```
FT_PER_M   = 3.280839895
M_PER_FT   = 1 / FT_PER_M
FT3_PER_M3 = 35.3146667
```

### 5.3 Technical Geometry — Metric (Engineering Base)

All derived fields must be reproducible from the **four base dimensions**: length, thickness, width, density.

| # | Label | Technical Field | Unit |
|---|-------|----------------|------|
| 27 | Length | `x_studio_length_m` | m |
| 28 | Thickness | `x_studio_thickness_mm` | mm |
| 29 | Width | `x_studio_width_mm_1` | mm |
| 30 | Volume (normalised) | `x_studio_volume_m3` | m³/lm |
| 31 | Weight | `x_studio_weight_kg` | kg |
| 32 | Density | `x_studio_density_kgm3_2` | kg/m³ |
| 33 | Square Factor | `x_studio_square_factor_1` | lm/m² |

All fields are Float, Studio-defined. #30 is the **canonical volume ratio** (thickness × width). #27 is the **engineering source of truth** for length.

### 5.4 Technical Geometry — Imperial

Imperial values **derive from metric** or are independently controlled for US products. Same structural fields, different physical units.

| 51 | Pallet Height | `x_studio_pallet_height_in` | inches |
| 52 | Pallet Width | `x_studio_pallet_width_in` | inches |

All fields are Float, Studio-defined.

| 53 | Boards per Pack | `x_studio_boards_per_pack` | Integer |
| 54 | Pcs per Layer | `x_studio_pcslayer` | Integer |
| 55 | Number of Layers | `x_studio_number_of_layers_1` | Integer |

### 5.6 Supply Chain & Replenishment

| # | Label | Technical Field | Type | Purpose |
|---|-------|----------------|------|---------|
| 64 | Rough Sawn Parent | `x_studio_rough_sawn_parent_id_3` | Char (master code) | Reporting only — stores the RS master code as text |
| 65 | Raw Material Origin | `x_studio_raw_material_origin_id_3` | Char (master code) | Reporting only — stores the WW master code as text |
| 66 | **Manufacturing Parent** | `kebony_parent_id` | **M2O to product.template** | **Production flow link — the actual parent this one is made FROM** |
| 67 | Supply Chain Rule | *(to be created)* | Selection | Drives replenishment route and lead time (see §5.6.1) |

**#64 and #65** are **legacy Studio char fields** that store parent MASTER codes (e.g. "1934", "2233"). They are good for reporting/grouping but do NOT enable flow traversal because they store text, not relational IDs.

**#66 `kebony_parent_id` (added 2026-04)** is the proper **Many2one to product.template** that enables the full production chain. It links each SKU to the exact parent SKU at the same length. Introduced to unlock these flows:

1. **Imperial → Metric conversion** (for US operations):
   - `1127-I-11.48 → 1127-M-3.5` (imperial SKU → its metric twin)
   - Enables: PO in US (imperial) → SO in BE (metric) → production in metric → delivery in metric → receipt converted back to imperial in US

2. **Production chain traversal** (for MRP and reporting):
   - Radiata: `2131-M-3.05 → 1935-M-3.05 → 1934-M-3.05` (FG → RS → WW, all at 3.05m)
   - Scots Pine: `1127-M-3.5 → 1003-M-3.5` (FG → WW, no RS layer)

**Population rules** (implemented in `tools/populate_parent_id.py`):
- Imperial SKU → metric twin at equivalent length (uses `length_m` matching)
- Metric SKU with RS populated → `{rs_master}-M-{length}` (Radiata/Clear chain)
- Metric SKU with only WW populated → `{ww_master}-M-{length}` (Scots Pine/Character chain, no RS)
- Metric RS SKU → `{ww_master}-M-{length}` (cascade from children's fields)
- Masters (`is_master_item`, `is_master_variant`, `is_product_family_1`) → None (grouping placeholders, not part of the chain)
- Pure WW SKUs (root of chain) → None

**Edge cases handled**:
- `x_studio_rough_sawn_parent_id_3 = 'N.A.'` (literal string) is filtered out
- `x_studio_rough_sawn_parent_id_3 = '2523 / 2423'` (concatenation bug) is filtered out
- Consignment variants (`(CON)`) follow the same rules as non-CON siblings

#### 5.6.A — Dual Semantics of `kebony_parent_id` (CRITICAL)

`kebony_parent_id` is a single field that **carries two different meanings depending on the SKU's measurement system**. This is intentional and must NOT be "fixed" by anyone reading it as a bug.

| SKU Measurement System | `kebony_parent_id` points to | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **Metric** | Another **Metric** SKU (raw material at the same length) | **Vertical / BoM**: "what raw material I am made FROM" — the manufacturing parent consumed in production |
| **Imperial** | The **Metric twin** SKU of the same physical product | **Horizontal / Bridge**: "what I really am, in the engineering metric reference" — the conversion link that drives US↔EU flow |

**Why the design**: AX is metric-native; all BoM logic lives in metric. The US sells in imperial. By making the Imperial SKU's parent point to its Metric twin, the system can flip automatically: a US PO in feet → SO in metres → production in metres → delivery in metres → received and labelled in feet at the US warehouse — with no parallel BoM tree for imperial.

**Rule for any code or screen that reads this field**: branch on `x_studio_measurement_system` before interpreting the parent. Treating both cases identically will produce silent corruption.

#### 5.6.B — Yield Trim Rule (Scots Pine Character chain)

The Scots Pine Character chain consumes raw white wood that is **10 cm longer** than the finished product (trim allowance):

| Output (FG) | Input (raw WW) | Trim |
|---|---|---|
| `1127-M-2.9` | `1003-M-3.0` | −10 cm |
| `1127-M-3.5` | `1003-M-3.6` | −10 cm |
| `1127-M-3.9` | `1003-M-4.0` | −10 cm |

The Phase A cleanup generator uses this rule to populate `kebony_parent_id` for SP Character. Radiata follows a different chain (FG → RS → WW with chemistry-driven yield, not a fixed trim).

**Implication for autoclave MO override**: when the planner overrides the proposed input length, the trim is no longer guaranteed. The override is constrained to the same Master family (e.g. `1003-M-*`) but the user must know that picking `1003-M-3.9` to produce a `1127-M-3.5` increases trim waste.

**Field definition**: `kebony_manufacturing/models/product_template.py`, added to the Studio product form via Odoo Studio (not via the kebony_manufacturing view file — that was deactivated to avoid conflict with existing Studio customizations).

**Important**: Kebony uses **`product.template` exclusively**, never `product.product`, because UoM and packaging are merged at the template level. All parent_id scripts query and write templates only.

#### 5.6.1 Supply Chain Rules

The **Supply Chain Rule** attribute determines the replenishment strategy, route configuration, and commercial lead time for each product. Four values:

| Rule | Stocking Point | Trigger | Lead Time |
|------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| **Make to Order** | None | Min. process batch reached | Full: procurement + production + transport |
| **ATO — White Wood** | White wood (untreated) | Min. white wood stock level | Production + transport |
| **ATO — Brown Wood** | Radiata rough sawn (treated) | Min. brown wood stock level | Machining + transport |
| **Make to Stock** | Finished goods | Min. FG stock level breach | Transport only |

**Make to Order (MTO)**
- No buffer stock held. Raw material ordered when a minimum process batch volume is accumulated from demand.
- Commercial lead time = longest chain (procurement + full production cycle + transport to customer).
- Replenishment rule: TBD — awaiting definition of minimum process batch trigger logic.

**Assemble to Order — White Wood (ATO-WW)**
- Buffer stock of **white wood** (untreated timber, e.g., white Radiata, white Scots Pine) is maintained at a minimum level.
- When a customer order arrives, production starts from the white wood stage (autoclave → dryer → machining).
- Commercial lead time = production cycle + transport.
- Min stock level driven by safety stock parameters on the white wood product.

**Assemble to Order — Brown Wood (ATO-BW)**
- Buffer stock of **brown wood** (treated rough sawn, e.g., Radiata rough sawn after autoclave + dryer, before machining) is maintained.
- When a customer order arrives, only **machining** is needed to produce the finished good.
- Commercial lead time = machining + transport.
- Min stock level driven by safety stock parameters on the rough sawn product.
- Applicable primarily to Radiata products where machining is the final conversion step.

**Make to Stock (MTS)**
- **Finished goods** buffer stock maintained at a target level.
- Replenishment triggered when projected stock approaches the minimum threshold.
- Commercial lead time = transport only (goods are already finished and available).
- Most mature / high-volume products will operate in this mode.

#### 5.6.2 Route & Lead Time Architecture

```
MTO:   [Procurement] → [Stacking] → [Autoclave] → [Dryer] → [Machining] → [Transport]
                                                                              ↑ full lead time

ATO-WW:              [White Wood Buffer]
                        ↓ trigger
                     [Autoclave] → [Dryer] → [Machining] → [Transport]
                                                              ↑ production + transport

ATO-BW:                           [Brown Wood Buffer]
                                     ↓ trigger
                                  [Machining] → [Transport]
                                                   ↑ machining + transport

MTS:                                             [Finished Goods Buffer]
                                                    ↓ trigger
                                                 [Transport]
                                                    ↑ transport only
```

The supply chain rule is set **per product** because the same cross-section may follow different strategies depending on market maturity, volume, and lifecycle stage. A product can transition from MTO (introduction) → ATO → MTS (mature) as demand stabilises.

#### 5.6.3 Product → Supply Chain Rule Assignment

> **STATUS: AWAITING INPUT FROM COO**
> The per-product assignment of supply chain rules has not yet been provided. The table below is a placeholder structure. Once the COO delivers the mapping, each product row will be populated with its assigned rule and the corresponding safety stock / reorder parameters.

| Master Item Code | Product Name | SC Rule | Buffer Product | Min Stock | Reorder Trigger | Notes |
|------------------|-------------|---------|----------------|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| *KEB-RAD-…* | *(example)* | MTO / ATO-WW / ATO-BW / MTS | *(if applicable)* | *(qty)* | *(rule)* | |
| … | … | … | … | … | … | |

**Expected deliverables from COO:**

1. Complete list of active finished-good products with their assigned supply chain rule (MTO / ATO-WW / ATO-BW / MTS)
2. For ATO and MTS products: the buffer product reference (white wood / brown wood / FG) and minimum stock level
3. For MTO products: minimum process batch trigger definition

### 5.9 Manufacturing & Planning Enrichment

These fields link products to the manufacturing process layer via the **Planning Family** model (`kebony.planning.family`). The planning family ID is the only editable field; all others are read-only related fields.

| # | Label | Technical Field | RO |
|---|-------|----------------|-----|
| 79 | Planning Family | `kebony_planning_family_id` | No |
| 80 | Stacking Hours | `kebony_family_stacking_hours_ref` | Yes |
| 81 | Autoclave Hours | `kebony_family_autoclave_hours_ref` | Yes |
| 82 | Dryer Hours | `kebony_family_dryer_hours_ref` | Yes |
| 83 | Dryer h/m³ | `kebony_family_capacity_weight` | Yes |
| 84 | Typical Load m³ | `kebony_family_typical_dryer_load_volume` | Yes |
| 85 | Min Process Qty | `kebony_family_minimum_process_qty` | Yes |
| 86 | Mix kg/m³ | `kebony_family_mix_consumption_per_m3` | Yes |
| 87 | Internal Scrap % | `kebony_family_scrap_internal_percent` | Yes |
| 88 | B-Grade Scrap % | `kebony_family_scrap_b_grade_percent` | Yes |

All Float. #79 is the only editable field (Many2one to `kebony.planning.family`). Fields #80–88 are related / readonly — inherited from the family record. #82 is the **bottleneck resource**.

### 5.10 Product Categories (Accounting Routing)

Product Category (`categ_id`) determines the GL account routing for inventory valuation, COGS, and revenue recognition.

| Category | Accounting Impact |
|----------|-------------------|
| Finished Product - Wood | FIFO valuation, standard COGS |
| Semi-Finished Product - Wood | WIP valuation |
| Raw Material - White Wood | Purchase → WIP conversion |
| Raw Material - Chemical | Consumed in BoM |
| Finished Product - Accessories | Separate COGS category |
| Product in Consignment | Consignment valuation rules |
| Sample Special / Standard | Sample cost tracking |
| Services | No inventory impact |
| Expenses | Expense category |
| Certificates | Service category |
| Deliveries | Logistics cost routing |
| Landed Costs | Cost adjustment layer |

### 5.11 Computed Stock Metric Fields

## 10. Traceability Doctrine

### 10.1 Lot-Level Identity

Each physical production batch receives a unique `stock.lot` record. The lot carries:

- Treatment information (fire retardant, colour finish, brushing)
- Metrics: linear meters, boards, volume (on hand / reserved / available)
- Pack reservation: link to reserved sales order
- Legacy fields: `x_studio_boards`, `x_studio_linear_feet`

### 10.2 Product ≠ Treatment

Treatment is a **post-production attribute** applied during or after the manufacturing process. It is **never** part of the product identity or SKU. This prevents combinatorial explosion and preserves the principle that product = dimensional specification.

### 10.3 FIFO Integrity

Odoo 19's lot-valuated FIFO ensures that each lot's cost is tracked independently. The product master data feeds the FIFO mechanism through:

- `lot_valuated = True` → per-lot cost tracking
- `tracking = 'lot'` → mandatory lot assignment
- Category → GL account routing for valuation

---

## 11. Metrics Computation Architecture

### 11.1 The Mixin: `kebony.metrics.mixin`

Abstract model inherited by: `stock.quant`, `stock.lot`, `stock.move`, `sale.order.line`, `account.move.line`, `product.template`.

Core methods:
- `_kebony_linear_qty_in_m(product, qty)` — normalise any quantity to meters
- `_kebony_boards_from_linear(linear_m, length_m)` — compute board count (ROUND_UP_THRESHOLD = 0.95)
- `_kebony_volume_m3(product, linear_m)` — compute volume using `x_studio_volume_m3`
- `_kebony_is_wood_product(product)` — check `x_studio_product_classification` for `"wood"`

### 11.2 Recompute Hierarchy

```
Level 1: stock.quant     ← source of truth
           ├→ stock.lot         (aggregate from internal quants)
           └→ product.template  (aggregate from internal quants)

Level 2: stock.move           (from move lines or demand qty)
         sale.order.line      (from SO line qty + UoM)
         account.move.line    (from invoice line qty + UoM)

Level 3: sale.order           (sum of order lines)
         account.move         (sum of invoice lines)
```

### 11.3 Wood-Only Rule

Physical metrics (linear m, boards, volume m³) are **only computed for wood products** (`x_studio_product_classification` contains `"wood"`). Accessories and services return 0 for all physical metrics.

---

## 12. Entity Type & Company Architecture

Products are shared across entities but features are gated by company type:

| Code | Company | Type | Features |
|------|---------|------|----------|
| `inc` | Kebony Inc. (US) | Distribution | BOL, accruals, margin, consignment |
| `holding` | Kebony Holding (BE) | Holding | Product master ownership |
| `bnv` | Kebony BNV (BE) | Manufacturing | Planning, BoM, manufacturing |
| `kas` | Kebony KAS (NO) | Legacy | Placeholder |
| `nas` | Kebony Norge AS (NO) | Legacy | Placeholder |

**Technical field**: `res.company.x_kebony_entity_type` (Selection)

**Key methods**: `_is_kebony_us()` returns True for INC, `_is_kebony_bnv()` returns True for BNV.

---

## 13. Governance Framework

### 13.1 The Master Data Guardian

**A Super Master Data Guardian must be nominated.** This person is the single point of accountability for product data integrity across the organisation.

**Role definition**:
- **Authority**: No product creation, modification, or decommissioning happens without the Guardian's explicit validation
- **Scope**: All entities, all product types, all fields marked as "governed"
- **Escalation**: Any field change that impacts accounting, manufacturing, or compliance requires Guardian sign-off
- **Cadence**: Weekly review of pending changes, monthly audit of data quality

**Why this matters**: A single incorrect volume ratio (`x_studio_volume_m3`) on a high-volume product can silently distort margin calculations across hundreds of invoices before detection. A wrong HS code triggers customs penalties. A missing planning family breaks manufacturing scheduling. Product data errors are **silent, compounding, and expensive**.

### 13.2 RACI Matrix

| Field Family | R | A | C | I |
|-------------|---|---|---|---|
| **Identity** | MDG | COO | Sales, Prod. | All |
| **Geometry — Metric** | CTO | MDG | Production | Finance |
| **Geometry — Imperial** | CTO | MDG | US Sales | Finance |
| **Packaging** | Prod. Planning | MDG | Logistics | Sales |
| **Classification** | Product Mgmt | MDG | Eng., Sales | Marketing |
| **Lifecycle** | Product Mgmt | MDG | Sales, Finance | All |
| **Commercial** | Sales Mgmt | MDG | Marketing | Operations |
| **Compliance** | Finance / Trade | MDG | Legal | Operations |
| **Manufacturing** | Prod. Planning | MDG | Engineering | Finance |
| **Pricing** | Finance | CFO | Sales | MDG |

*MDG = Master Data Guardian. R = Responsible, A = Accountable, C = Consulted, I = Informed.*

### 13.3 Change Control Process

```
1. REQUEST    → Change request submitted (Jira / email) with:
                - Field(s) to change
                - Current value → proposed value
                - Business justification
                - Impact assessment (which domains affected?)

2. REVIEW     → Master Data Guardian evaluates:
                - Cross-domain impact (see §2 impact map)
                - Financial impact (margin, valuation, tax)
                - Operational impact (warehouse, manufacturing)

3. APPROVE    → Guardian signs off (or escalates to CFO/COO)

4. EXECUTE    → Change applied in Odoo (Studio or code deployment)

5. VALIDATE   → Post-change verification:
                - Metrics recompute correctly?
                - Existing orders/invoices unaffected?
                - Manufacturing planning intact?

6. DOCUMENT   → Change logged in product change register
```

### 13.4 Critical Rules

1. **No bulk updates without Guardian approval** — mass imports must be validated row-by-row against the field registry
2. **No Studio field creation without documentation** — every `x_studio_*` field must be documented in this registry before creation
3. **No field renaming** — Studio fields cannot be renamed after creation (Odoo limitation). Plan names carefully.
4. **Metric fields are read-only for non-Engineering** — volume, density, section area must only be modified by Engineering with Guardian sign-off
5. **Lifecycle transitions are one-way** — a product cannot move from Decommissioned back to Mature without executive approval
6. **Imperial derives from Metric** — imperial geometry values must be mathematically consistent with metric base values

---

## 14. Development Rules

### 14.1 Code Architecture

- **No duplicate logic**: All metric computations centralised in `KebonyMetricsMixin`
- **Studio fields documented exactly as named**: The typos in `x_studio_word_species` and `x_studio_customer_catagory` are permanent — never create "corrected" aliases
- **No hidden logic**: All derived fields must be reproducible from base geometry using documented formulas
- **All computed fields must declare dependencies**: Odoo's ORM compute framework requires explicit `@api.depends` declarations

### 14.2 Field Naming Convention

| Pattern | Origin | Rule |
|---------|--------|------|
| `x_studio_*` | Odoo Studio | Read-only in code |
| `x_kebony_*` | Python (bol_report) | Native codebase field |
| `kebony_*` | Python (manufacturing) | Newer naming standard |
| Standard Odoo | Core (`name`, `categ_id`) | Follow Odoo conventions |

### 14.3 Formula Reference

| Derived Field | Formula |
|--------------|---------|
| Volume (m³/lm) | thickness(m) × width(m) |
| Section m² | thickness(m) × width(m) |
| lm per m³ | 1 / `x_studio_volume_m3` |
| lm per m² | 1 / width(m) |
| Weight per lm | density × volume(m³/lm) |
| Boards | ROUND(linear_m / length_m), threshold 0.95 |
| Total volume | linear_m × `x_studio_volume_m3` |

---

## 15. Import & Migration Reference

### 15.1 Excel Source

| Sheet | Purpose | Records |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `MASTERDATA_METRIC_import` | Metric products — full field set (81 columns) | 147 products |
| `MASTERDATA_IMPERIAL_import` | Imperial products — same structure | 117 products |
| `import_master item` | Master Item grouping records | ~70 records |
| `import_master variant` | Master Variant grouping records | ~80 records |
| Reference sheets | Model values (Application, Shape, etc.) | Various |

### 15.2 Field Name Mapping (Import → Odoo)

Key fields where the import column name differs from the vault doc's simplified names:

| Actual Technical Name | Old Vault Name |
|----------------------|---------------|
| `x_studio_master_item_code` | `x_master_item_code` |
| `x_studio_master_variant_code_1` | `x_master_variant_code` |
| `x_studio_word_species` | `x_wood_species` |
| `x_studio_many2one_field_3oj…` | Application |
| `x_studio_many2one_field_6up…` | Shape Value |
| `x_studio_pcslayer` | `x_pcs_per_layer` |
| `x_studio_number_of_layers_1` | `x_layers` |

*Note: The Studio-generated field names with random suffixes (e.g., `_3oj_1jaj6o7st`) are permanent Odoo identifiers. Always use the exact technical name in code and imports.*

### 15.3 AX Decimeter Length Encoding

Source files exported from Axapta (legacy ERP) — including `RecipeFamily.xlsx` and the BoM/master-data feeds — encode lengths in **decimeters** as a `-NN` suffix on the SKU code. Divide by 10 to get metres.

| In source file | Means |
|---|---|
| `1127 - 29` | SKU `1127-M-2.9` (2.9 m) |
| `1003 - 30` | SKU `1003-M-3.0` (3.0 m) |
| `1935 - 35` | SKU `1935-M-3.5` (3.5 m) |
| `1934 - 36` | SKU `1934-M-3.6` (3.6 m) |

**Rule for any import or migration script**: always divide the `-NN` suffix by 10 before mapping to `x_studio_length_m`. The resulting `default_code` should be `{master}-M-{length_m}` with one decimal (e.g. `3.5`, not `3.50`).

This convention is metric-only. Imperial SKUs use foot integers (`1127-I-10` = 10 ft, no division).

### 15.4 Phase A Cleanup (in progress, paused 2026-04-24)

Active migration: rebuilding the product master to enforce the 3-level hierarchy and `kebony_parent_id` chain. State and artefacts:

- Plan: `08 - Migration Playbook/Product Master Cleanup Plan.md`
- Generator: `tools/product_master_generate.py` (review Excel, no Odoo writes)
- Latest review Excel: `Product_Master_Cleanup_v0.1_draft.xlsx`
- Phase B (write-to-Odoo applier) not yet started

Outstanding business decisions tracked in the cleanup state memory: 5 unresolved Scots Pine SKUs, RS length model (FG-lengths vs standard-RS), `x_studio_length_1` vs `x_studio_length_m` reconciliation, Imperial UoM rename `ft` → `LF`.

## 16. Strategic Impact

This product master data architecture:

1. **Drives cubic-based margin logic** — every financial KPI reconciles to m³ through the normalised volume ratio
2. **Enables dryer-centric manufacturing planning** — planning family links products to process parameters and bottleneck constraints
3. **Preserves FIFO integrity** — lot-valuated tracking with mandatory lot assignment prevents cost mixing
4. **Supports multi-entity operations** — shared product masters across BNV (manufacturing), INC (distribution), Holding
5. **Enables analytical accounting** — product category and classification drive GL routing and analytic distribution
6. **Ensures trade compliance** — HS codes, commodity codes, and country of origin are first-class fields with governance
7. **Scales without SKU explosion** — treatment at lot level, no dimensional variants, three-level hierarchy keeps the catalogue manageable

---

## 17. Forward-Looking Architecture

This section captures architectural intent that is **not yet implemented** but must inform any code, screen, or process change touching the product master. Discussed and validated 2026-04-27.

### 17.1 Master-Centric Management Screen (planned)

The current product form is SKU-centric: users edit one length variant at a time, on a screen polluted with 18+ duplicate-label Studio fields and no view of related lengths. This is unsustainable for a catalogue of ~490 records, especially when most attributes (cross-section, planning family, supplier, classification) are constant across all lengths of a Master.

**Target**: a **master-centric form** where the daily working unit is the Master, not the SKU. Lengths surface as a list inside the Master, with bulk operations available.

**Key sections (notebook tabs)**:

| Tab | Content |
|---|---|
| General | Identity, classification, lifecycle, planning family |
| Geometry | Cross-section dimensions (constant across lengths), volume ratio, density |
| Supply Chain | Procurement, supplier, route, lead time, supply chain rule |
| Sales | Pricelists, customer category, sales description, market portfolios |
| Manufacturing | `kebony_parent_id` chain, BoM coefficients, yield, scrap |
| Inventory | UoM, packaging, tracking, certifications |
| Accounting | Category, valuation, GL routing |
| Lengths | Length matrix (metric + imperial side by side), per-length stock, override fields |
| Chain | Upstream parent Master, downstream consuming Masters (smart buttons) |

**Length matrix (key UX win)**:

| Length | Metric SKU | Metric On Hand | Imperial SKU | Imperial On Hand | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

**Master-level smart buttons**:
- On-hand stock (sum across all length children)
- Open MOs / SOs / POs
- "Used as raw material in" (downstream Masters that consume me)
- "Consumes" (upstream Master(s) I am made FROM)

**Lifecycle states (Master level)**:

| State | Allowed transitions | Sales / Production impact |
|---|---|---|
| Draft | → Active | Cannot sell, cannot produce |
| Active | → Phasing-out, Archived | Full operations |
| Phasing-out | → Archived | No new orders, fulfil existing |
| Archived | (terminal) | Read-only |

Activation gate: Draft → Active is **blocked** until required fields are populated (planning family, classification, `x_studio_volume_m3`, `kebony_parent_id` for non-raw masters, BoM template for FG/RS, accounting category with `property_stock_account_production_cost_id` set — see `project_product_master_config_checklist.md`).

### 17.2 Description Propagation Model

**Problem**: the current `x_studio_description` is per-SKU. A Master may have 12 length children. Updating the commercial description (e.g. species marketing name change) requires editing 12 records and is error-prone.

**Target model**: a Master-level **description stem** + computed length-level **description full**.

```
Master record
  └── description_stem  = "Kebony Scots Pine Character 22×100 mm"

Length child SKU
  └── description_full  = description_stem + " | " + length_label
                        = "Kebony Scots Pine Character 22×100 mm | 3.5 m"
```

**Rules**:
- `description_stem` lives on the Master and is the **single source of truth** for the prefix
- `description_full` on each length SKU is **computed** — never directly edited
- The "Propagate" button on the Master is no-op for description (always live via compute)
- Per-length one-off override available via optional `description_override` field, blank by default
- `length_label` = `"3.5 m"` for metric, `"10 ft"` for imperial — auto-generated from `x_studio_length_m` / `x_studio_length_1`

**Migration plan**: when introduced, the existing per-SKU `x_studio_description` becomes a **read-only mirror** of `description_full` (or is retired entirely once all consumers have migrated).

### 17.3 Description Localization (deferred)

Beyond the stem + length composition, customers in different markets need descriptions in their **local language** with potentially **country-specific naming conventions** (species names, certification phrasing, dimension units in mm vs cm).

**Deferred design** (not for current iteration — captured in `project_product_description_localization.md`):
- New model `kebony.product.description.localization`: `master_id` × `country_id` × `lang_id` → `description_stem`
- Resolution chain: country+lang → lang only → default master stem
- The computed `description_full` on each length SKU resolves the right localization based on context (sale order partner, BoL destination, invoice country)

**Implication for §17.2 design today**: keep the master-level `description_stem` as the *default* value. Do not paint into a corner by hard-coding it as the single source — leave a clean extension point for the localization child model.

### 17.4 Studio Field Cleanup (pulled in by the master screen redesign)

The product form currently shows ~18 duplicate-label Studio field pairs (e.g. two fields both labelled "Description", two labelled "Rough Sawn Parent ID"), generating Warning on every odoo.sh build. This redesign is the natural opportunity to migrate the keep-worthy Studio fields to native Python fields and retire the duplicates. Tracked in `project_studio_fields_cleanup.md`.
